# Smash4Discord
Easy Discord Rich Presence for Smash 4.

## Tutorial
**1.** Download this file and extract it. (see releases)

###   WARNING
  Your computer may detect the exe file in this tool to be a virus, trojan specifically. **This is a false positive.**
  This is only happening because the exe is trying to access another app on your computer (Discord).
  
  **2.** Go into the `config presets` folder and choose your current mode. (More to hopefully be added later). Copy this file
  and paste it into the `app` folder, and rename it to `config.ini`.
  
  **3.** Finally, open the exe file. A screen should appear telling you what current settings are chosen. From here, go into
  Discord and set `Smash4Discord.exe` as the game you're playing. Switching your config file while the exe is still running
  will auto-update it, so there is no need to close or re-open it.
  
  ## Editing the config file
  
  It is possible to edit the `config.ini` file to customize what you are doing. *Never change the Client ID*.
  #### Switching your console
  If you play Smash Bros. on the 3DS and would like the Rich Presence to indicate this, replace `sys_wiiu` in every preset to
  `sys_3ds` and change the *Wii U* text to *3DS*.
  #### All images
  There are quite a few images that can be used as the primary image (the larger one) in your Rich Presence. Here is a list of
  them:
